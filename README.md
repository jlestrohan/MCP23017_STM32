# MCP23017_STM32
STM32 HAL Driver for MCP23017 Multiplexer

I could not find  reliable drivers on the STM32 for this multiplexer chip so I decided to write mine.

Drop both files in your Core Inc/Src directories, read .h for instructions, don"t forget to read the chip datasheet as well located at 
http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20001952C.pdf

This driver works great, it's not perfect yet but feel free to suggest improvements if you like.
